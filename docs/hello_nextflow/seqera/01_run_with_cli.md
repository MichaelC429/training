We'll start by using the Nextflow CLI to launch a pipeline and monitor it in Seqera Platform.
Start by logging into the [Seqera Platform](https://cloud.seqera.io/).

!!! info "Nextflow Tower"
Seqera Platform was previously known as Nextflow Tower.
You'll still see references to the previous name in environment variable and cli option names.

### 1.1. Set up your Seqera Platform token by exporting it to your environment

Follow these steps to set up your token:

1.  Create a new token by clicking on the **Settings** drop-down menu:

    ![Create a token](img/usage_create_token.png)

2.  Name your token:

    ![Name your token](img/usage_name_token.png)

3.  Save your token safely:

    ![Save token](img/usage_token.png)

    !!! note

        Leave this browser tab open as we will need the token once more to store it as a Nextflow secret.

4.  Export your token:

    Open a terminal and type:

    ```bash
    export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ1ZTE=
    ```

    Where `eyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxQ1ZTE=` is the token you have just created.

### 1.2. Run Nextflow cli with Seqera Platform visualizing and capturing logs

Run your Nextflow workflows as usual with the addition of the `-with-tower` command:

```bash
nextflow run nextflow-io/hello -with-tower
```

You will see the following output:

```console title="Output"
 N E X T F L O W   ~  version 24.04.4
